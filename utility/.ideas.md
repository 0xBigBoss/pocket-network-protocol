# Ideas

There are lots of ideas that have been discussed

## Client Side Challenge Validation

Address Swaps / Address Posioning

### Ad

## Gateway Protocol

## Governance Protocol

- [ ] Lots of opportunities for tokenomic models around gateways

## Volume Computation

- [ ] Document Client Side Challenges
- [ ] Document "Would you like a proof with that?" workflow
- [ ] Enable multiple RelayChains per session
- [ ] Enable registration in multiple GeoLocations per actor
- [ ] Enable Business opportunities
- [ ] Expand Rate Limiting algorithm so different requests cost different amounts
- [ ] Enable delegated staking (validation, servicing, monitoring, etc...)
- [ ] Enable revenue sharing through multiplicity of the OperatorPublicKey
- [ ] Look into the use of Proof-of-Sequential algorithms for volume estimation
- [ ] Look into replacing the ProofAndClaim/CommitAndReveal workflow with more modern zero-knowledge approaches
- [ ] Describe the use of k-of-n multisigs to be used by the DAO
- [ ] Document self dealing attacks

## Tokenomics
